# The FeatureVis library

## Quick Start Guide

Every function requires a network and an image. So let's load the network first. After you have loaded MatConvNet use the normal load function for networks of type simpleNN:

```Matlab
net = load('your-simplenn-network.mat');
```

For networks of type DagNN use:

```Matlab
net = DDagNN.loadobj(load('your-dag-network.mat'));
```

A function shipped with the FeatureVis library. The DDagNN object implements special functions needed for the deconvolutional methods.

Next we need an image, once in its original version and once resized and normalized according to the specifications of the network you are going to use:

```Matlab
im = imread('your-image.jpg');
im_ = single(im);
im_ = imresize(im_, net.meta.normalization.imageSize(1:2));
im_ = im_ - net.meta.normalization.averageImage;
```

Now we can do some visualizations. Let's start by using Guided Backpropagation on the strongest activated class:

```Matlab
graphical_deconvolution(net, im, im_);
```

Let's compare it to normal Backpropagation:

```Matlab
graphical_deconvolution(net, im, im_, 'ReLUPass', 'Backpropagation');
```

Maybe we are interested in the features supporting another class:

```Matlab
graphical_deconvolution(net, im, im_, 'MeasureFilter', 42);
```

What if we want the computations to run on the GPU? Just use a gpuArray as input:

```Matlab
im_ = gpuArray(im_);
graphical_deconvolution(net, im, im_);
```

This works for all methods.

Let's use the occlusion method. For this method we have to specify the side length of the occluded area and the step width with which the occlusion box is moved across the image. Let's use a size of 32x32 pixels and a step width of 16 pixels:

```Matlab
graphical_occlusion(net, im, im_, {32, 16});
```

Maybe we want our occlusion box to have a specific color. Then we can specify it as RGB:

```Matlab
graphical_occlusion(net, im, im_, 'BoxColor', [128 64 -128], {32, 16});
```

Pay attention to the fact that these colors are used unmodified. So use the normalized image as basis for your color space.

What if we want a rectangular occlusion box? Just replace the two values from above with four to specify the size and stride along the width and the size and stride along the height of the image, so for a occlusion box 64 pixels wide and 32 pixels high use:

```Matlab
graphical_occlusion(net, im, im_, {64, 16, 32, 16});
```

To move the occlusion box with a step width of 16 pixels along the width and 32 pixels along the height of the image use:

```Matlab
graphical_occlusion(net, im, im_, {64, 16, 64, 32});
```

This concludes this short introduction. We hope you have fun experimenting with this library. The documentation for all methods can be found below or in the source code.
